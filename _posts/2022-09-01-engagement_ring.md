# Introduction

I designed, cast, and set the stone in the engagement ring I gave to my partner. We collaborated on the design, then drew several variations in Blender and printed them in castable wax resin. I encased the wax positives in plaster using the investment casting process, burned out the wax, then cast the ring using my home-built foundry. Then, I finished and polished the ring and set the stone.

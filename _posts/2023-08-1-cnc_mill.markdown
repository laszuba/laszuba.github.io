# Abstract

I built a CNC mill/router loosely based on the [https://wiki.printnc.info/](PrintNC Mini) project. I modified most of the critical motion components so they could be machined on my manual mill, instead of 3D printing parts to later be replaced with CNC machined ones. I also designed and built an enclosure including a full drain tub and a flood coolant system. The controller runs LinuxCNC with a Mesa Ethernet IO card.

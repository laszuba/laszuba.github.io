# Investment Casting

I've been primarily interested in investment casting for the high detail, and lack of constraints on form and undercuts.

# Foundry

I built a small furnace / foundry to facilitate casting, constructed out of fire brick and a welded steel frame. It originally ran using a large torch, but I've since built a proper propane burner using cast aluminum parts.

# Dog Model

Our nephew went through a phase where he was very excited about dogs. We decided to make him a metal dog model for him to play with (well, really more for his mom to remember this phase). My partner created a polymer clay model, then I used photogrammetry to 3D scan it. I split the scan in two halves and corrected undercuts in Blender, then printed it on an SLA machine. Using petrobond sand, I cast the model in aluminum then sanded and polished it.

I'm a licensed amateur radio operator, callsign AJ6NC. I enjoy building various electronics projects related to radio.

# SOTA / POTA

I activated Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay as part of the Parks on the Air and Summits on the Air challenges. The antenna was a home-built EFHW on 20m, held up by an extendable fiberglass mast. The radio was a Yaesu FT-891 (not the best choice, a little heavy to lug around).

# CW (Morse Code) Trainer

A quick weekend project to help practice my CW skills, especially transmitting. I developed a keyer with custom firmware and a 3D printed key to go alongside it.

## Abstract

"Dynamic Flowers" was conceived leading up to my wedding. Instead of a typical altar, myself and my partner wanted to showcase an artwork that incorportated movement and material. To finish in time, I had to substantially narrow the scope from the original intention; 5 flowers on 3 stands. The remaining flowers are currently being manufactured to complete the artwork.

The sculpture consists of 12 petals controlled by 4 motors with complete position feedback. The underside is illuminated by a full-colour LED array designed for smooth dimming and natural colour reproduction through an additional white channel and software spectral optimization. The petal position, and light colour and brightness can be commanded over a standard theatrical lighting control protocol (`DMX512`) from any standard source. For the wedding, a controller based on a Raspberry Pi was provided to the DJ. The controller played back recorded sequences or loops created in TouchDesigner to the flower throughout the ceremony and evening.

# Purse

I've been enjoying experimenting with novel hardware to incorporate into leather work. This purse was designed around a buckle created with 3 layers of welded metal, forming a pocket. The pin is turned from 304 stainless. The frame is bent and welded mild steel, powder coated black.

# Waist Belt

Continuing with the theme of custom hardware, I developed a buckle that uses a similar pin closure to the purse. It was machined from brass, plated in nickel, and incorporated into a waist belt for my partner.
